<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:28px;">Statistics Help for non-Math People!</h1>

Students and Professionals who are not statistical experts often need to use
statistics.  Get help from [an expert](about.html) who not only knows
statistics, but knows how to talk about it.

You don't just need a robot or a computer program to spit out numbers,
you need someone who can explain data collection and analysis with
you!

> Maybe you are a graduate student working on a dissertation and your advisor
> handed you a thick statistics book and told you to "just do it like
> this"...

> Maybe you are a social worker whose boss told you to do a survey to help
> protect your agency's funding...

> Maybe you have spreadsheets full of data but no idea how to start telling a
> story with them...

Get statistics help from someone who doesn't just do the numbers but knows how
to explain it to you!
