Dr. Neil Martinsen-Burrell has been teaching students at the college
level for almost twenty years in the areas of mathematics and
statistics.  He has helped hundreds of student researchers to understand
the important issues in their experiments including collecting, storing,
and processing data as well as analyzing and communicating the results.

Dr. Neil received a B.S. degree in Mathematics from Harvey Mudd College
in Claremont, CA and a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University
of Colorado at Boulder.  He has worked at the University of North
Carolina in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and Wartburg College in Waverly,
Iowa.  He has done research in geophysical sciences as well as teaching
math and statistics at all levels.

Neil enjoys helping students and researchers to focus on the most
important questions that they are trying to answer and what methods to
use to answer those questions. He excels at explaining mathematical
concepts to non-mathematical students.  He has worked with students and
researchers in biology, chemistry, psychology, political science,
economics, education, and other disciplines.

After 9 years of teaching in colleges, in 2013 Dr. Neil started his
independent statistical consulting service.  He is focused on helping
student researchers to understand their statistical needs and methods.
